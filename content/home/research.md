**Labor Market Consequences of Restatements for Corporate Accountants** (**Job Market Paper**)

- **Presentations**: 2018 AAA FARS Conference (Accepted to present), 2017 AAA/Deloitte/J. Michael Cook Doctoral Consortium, 2017 MSU Brown Bag
- **Summary**: I examine the impact of restatements on the labor market outcomes for corporate accountants. I use LinkedIn to identify a comprehensive sample of corporate accountants who work for firms that restated their financial statements between 2004 and 2014. My findings suggest that the labor market disciplines corporate accountants after restatements are announced. Internal auditors could minimize the adverse labor market outcomes of restatements by proactively departing.

**Traditional Media, Twitter and Business Scandals** (with John Jiang)

- **Summary**: We examine how traditional media and Twitter cover four business scandals. We find that newspaper articles are more highly associated with a firm's abnormal stock returns and trading volumes than individual tweets. Besides disseminating and magnifying the content of traditional media, individuals provide news lead to traditional media through Twitter and lead newspaper coverage. Overall, we conclude that social media such as Twitter complement rather than substitute traditional media in covering business scandals.

**SEC-Affiliated Lawyers and Corporate Disclosures** (with Samuel Tan)

- **Summary**: We examine the impact of individual lawyers on the comment letter process. Using a hand-collected database of lawyers that represent firms in responding to SEC comment letters. We find evidence that involving SEC-affiliated lawyers in comment letter conversations is associated with less timely resolution, more conversation rounds, and fewer financial statement amendments, relative to involving other lawyers.
